          <h3>The Conference</h3>
          <p>
            The uncodeference is a place to learn, meet new friends, share ideas and have lots of fun. We wanna provide the best place for a
            true&nbsp;
            <Link to="#what-is-an-unconference">
              <i>unconference</i>
            </Link>
            &nbsp;experience. We want to connect people and build a place where thoughts and experiences can be exchanged in the most
            awesome way.
          </p>
          <p>
            From our last year's experience this worked pretty well and this year we wanna bring this idea further. That's the reason why
            the conference might seem as a 3-day event. We've got
            <ul>
              <li>
                the <b>un&lt;meet&gt;up</b> on Thursday the 9<sup>th</sup>
              </li>
              <li>
                the <b>un{'{code}'}ference</b> on Friday the 10<sup>th</sup>
              </li>
              <li>
                and the <b>(un)hike</b> on Saturday the 11<sup>th</sup>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Just to make sure, the&nbsp;
            <b>
              main event takes place on Friday the 10<sup>th</sup>
            </b>
            &nbsp;and this is also the date a ticket is needed. The&nbsp;<b>un&lt;meet&gt;up</b>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<b>(un)hike</b>&nbsp;are
            satellite events for the community, we would be really happy if you join in, but it's completely up to you!

          <h3>The Meetup</h3>
          <p>
            Due to the great feedback of last year's uncodeference we decided to convert the formerly known ReactJS Tirol meetup into
            the&nbsp;<b>un&lt;meet&gt;up</b>&nbsp;and broadened up it's topics to software engineering in general.
            <br />
            Because of it being grown out of the uncodeference we decided to host it this year alongside the uncodeference as a satellite
            event. For more info and RSVP please visit&nbsp;

              our GitHub repository

            &nbsp; where everything is organized by the community! We are looking forward to see you there!
